# This files spcifies the scope generators for `Java`. 
# In `edges.toml`, we specify how the rules should be chained by constructing an edge labelled graph with rules as nodes. 
# These edges are labelled as - Parent, Global, Method and Class. These edges determine "scope" where the next rule will be applied with respect
# to the previously applied rule. 
# Unlike Parent and Global scopes, capturing Method and Class scopes for Java is unique to Java's syntax. 
# Each language has a syntax to define methods, classes, functions, therefore capturing such scopees is language dependent. 
# This file allows users to define these language dependent scopes. 
# Each scope consists of a scope name and a list of scope rules. 
# Each scope rule consists of a `enclosing_node` and a `scope`.

# When Piranha encounters a "Method" or "Class" scope, it looks up these configurations to obtain the list of scope rules. 
# It then applies each `scope.rules.matcher` to the ancestors of changed node in the previous edit.
# Upon finding the match (it short-circuits), Piranha substitutes the tags in `scope.rulesscope` based on the tag matches obtained from
# matching `scope.rules.matcher` to create a context specific rule for the changed node.

# Example : 
#
# pub void foo(int a, int b, int c, int d, int e){
#   // Let's assume that some rule was previously applied within this method body.
# }  
#
# To capture the signature of the enclosing method, Piranha will match the below rule against the method.
# This will result in matches - { n: "foo", fp: "int a, int b, int c, int d, int e"} 
# Substituting these matches in the `scopes.rulesscope` will result in :
#
#(((method_declaration 
#           name : (_) @z
#           parameters : (formal_parameters)@fp) @xdn)

# (#eq? @z "@foo")
# (#eq? @tp "int a, int b, int c, int d, int e")
