NOTE: This project is currently configured to build as part of the larger `piranha/java` build. If you wish to build this sample as a standalone gradle project, you need to:

1) Copy this directory and its contents outside of the Piranha project structure.
2) Edit or make a new `build.gradle` following the instructions on the [main PiranhaJava README.md](../README.md) file.
3) Run `gradle wrapper` and then `./gradlew build` ("The recommended way to execute any Gradle build is with the help of the Gradle Wrapper" - [Gradle User Guide](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html))
